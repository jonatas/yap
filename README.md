# Yap

This gem was build in a live coding session at [Shift Dev Conf](https://dev.shiftconf.co/).

## Usage

Check out specs and see what it do :)

This is the core feature I extract from [fast](https://github.com/jonatas/fast)
and the idea is show how to build a small parser and runner.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

You cannot contribute because it's a simple demo project.
Please contribute to [fast](https://github.com/jonatas/fast).
